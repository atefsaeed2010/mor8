; ================== EXAMPLE ======================================================

; example how to describe actions for some DID
; as example imagine call comes from DID: 123456789
; lets describe actions to be taken to the call which comes from such DID:

; exten => 123456789,1,NoOp(Call came from DID 123456789, HURRAY!) ;some log to show on CLI
; exten => 123456789,2,Playback(tt-monkeys) ;lets play silly audio for this DID
; exten => 123456789,3,Hangup ;end the call

; ============= END OF EXAMPLE ====================================================




; These actions will be taken if call comes from the DID which is not described in this context
exten => _X.,1,NoOp(EXTERNAL DID PBX FUNCTION DIAL-PLAN)
exten => _X.,2,NoOp(ERROR: You see this message because you routed call from DID to PBX Function External DID and did not created special entry for this DID in the file /etc/asterisk/extensions_mor_external_did.conf. Check this file for more explanation!)
exten => _X.,3,Hangup
