#   About:  It is vitally important that server time would be correct during server install/upgrade. This script synchronizes system clock with one of internet ntp time servers
#
#   Arguments:
#
#       $1  -   FIRST_INSTALL           #  if this argument is present the script immeadiately exits if any failure occours this way aborting further installation
#       NO ARGUMENTS                    #  will try to synchronize the time, will report { FAILED, OK } silently
