; ABOUT THIS FILE
;
; This configuration file describes blacklisting rules


; Rules have the following structure: 
;
; type,prefix,count,period,score
;
; type   - type of rule (src/dst/ip/dstsrc/dstduration/srcduration/srclength/dstlength/srcbldst)
; prefix - prefix or keyword (only for src) used to match the target (src/dst/ip)
; count  - how many TIMES this target can be dialed/make calls during specified period of time (in minutes), before this rule is applied
; period - defines the PERIOD of time (in minutes) which is used to check calls (takes all calls made within last X minutes)
; score  - score that will be ADDED to previous score of the target
;
; Note1: to match all the targets of the same rule type, use * symbol instead of prefix
; Note2: in case of dstduration and srcduration, count is time in seconds of a call
; Note3: in case of dstlength and srclength, count is the length of the number
; Note4: in case of dstsrc rule, you can you EMPTY keyword instead prefix. This allows to block dst if numbers without src are calling to this dst
; Note5: in case of srcbldst rule, count is blacklisting score of dst number
;
; Rule types explained


; Type: src
; Description: put a score on src, based on src number and number of calls FROM that src in a defined time period
;
; Examples:
;
; src,mor,1,5,10
; src,1001,1,10,20
;
; Examples explained:
;
; 1. If src 'accountant_mor_25' makes 1 or more calls during 5 minutes period, its blacklisting score will be updated by 10
; 2. If src '1001' makes 1 or more calls during 10 minutes period, its blacklisting score will be updated by 20


; Type: dst
; Description: put a score on dst, based on dst number and number of calls TO that dst in a defined time period
;
; Examples:
;
; dst,370,5,60,50
; dst,37621,5,60,30
; dst,*,10,10,10
;
; Examples explained:
;
; 1. If dst '37062255555' is dialed 5 or more times during 60 minutes period, its blacklisting score will be increased by 50
; 2. If dst '37062155555' is dialed 5 or more times during 60 minutes period, its blacklisting score will be increased by 30
; 3. If any dst is dialed 10 or more times during 10 minutes period, its blacklisting score will be increased by 10


; Type: ip
; Description: put a score on ip, based on ip address and number of calls FROM that ip address in a defined time period
;
; Examples:
;
; ip,78.35,1,15,1
;
; Examples explained:
;
; 1. If ip '78.35.45.21' makes 1 or more calls during 15 minutes period, its blacklisting score will be increased by 1


; Type: dstsrc
; Description: put a score on dst, based on src number and number of calls FROM that src in a defined time period
;
; Examples:
;
; dstsrc,anonymous,1,5,50
; dstsrc,EMPTY,1,5,50
; 
; 1. If src 'anonymous' makes 1 or more calls during 5 minutes period, then blacklisting score will be increased by 50 TO THE NUMBER USER HAS DIALED (dst number)
; 2. If call with no src makes 1 or more calls during 5 minutes period, then blacklisting score will be increased by 50 TO THE NUMBER USER HAS DIALED (dst number)


; Type: dstduration
; Description: put a score on dst, based on lowest call duration to this dst number in a defined time period
;
; Examples:
;
; dstduration,370,30,5,45
; 
; 1. If within last 5 minutes there are calls to dst number 370xxxxxx that have duration shorter than 30 seconds, then dst number's score will be increased by 45


; Type: srcduration
; Description: put a score on src, based on lowest call duration from this src number in a defined time period
;
; Examples:
;
; srcduration,*,60,1,45
; 
; 1. If within last minute there are calls from any src number that have duration shorter than 60 seconds, then src number's score will be increased by 45


; Type: dstlength
; Description: put a score on dst, based on length of dst number and number of calls to this dst in a defined time period
;
; Examples:
;
; dstlength,*,6,1,10
; 
; 1. If within last minute there are calls to any dst number that has length shorter or equal to 6 charaters, then dst number's score will be increased by 10
;
; In this case:
;
; Number 370621 will be blacklisted
; Number 3706215 will not be blacklisted


; Type: srclength
; Description: put a score on src, based on length of src number and number of calls to this dst in a defined time period
;
; Examples:
;
; srclength,*,2,5,30
; 
; 1. If within last 5 minutes there are calls from any src number that has length shorter or equal to 2 charaters, then src number's score will be increased by 30


; Type: srcbldst
; Description: put a score on src if user calls to dst which has equal or higher score than defined
;
; Examples:
;
; srcbldst,*,60,2,30
;
; 1. If within last 2 minutes any src number made a call to dst which has blacklisting score 60 or higher, then src number's score will be increased by 30


; To comment out a rule, use ; character before rule
;
; Note: only one rule will be applied to the same src/dst/ip so rules should be ordered by prefix length (from longest to shortest (or *))

; Rules start here, please modify them


src,mor,1,5,10
src,1001,1,10,20
