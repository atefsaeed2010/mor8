THIS SCRIPT IS DEDICATED FOR RESELLER UPGRADE TO ADMIN (TO SEPARATE SYSTEM)
E.G. RESELLER BECOMES ADMIN

IMPORTANT!
---------------
1. This script is made for MOR X4 Reseller upgrade to Admin, NOT FOR RS PRO!!!
2. Database which has millions of calls will take hours to process, be patient, check top mysql processs to make sure it is working


HOW IT WORKS
---------------
Script deletes all non-relevant info from DB and "upgrades" Reseller to Admin together with all his related data.


HOW TO USE IT
---------------
1. Make full backup of DB from which you want to upgrade reseller to admin (mysqldump -u mor -pmor mor > mor.sql)
2. Prepare new server with fresh MOR X4 installation
3. Copy mor.sql file to the new server and import this file to the server (mysql -u mor -pmor mor < mor.sql)
4. Check the ID of the Reseller (FRIENDLY advide: if you don't know how to do this - abort the task and hand it over to your colleague)
5. Open file /usr/src/mor/sh_scripts/rs_admin_upgrade/db_changes.sql and replace all numbers '5' to your Reseller ID, save and close
6. Open same file again, search for '5' (without quotes). If you find at least one appearance of this - go back to step 5 and repeat
7. Run screen and within it execute ./rs_admin_upgrade.sh
8. Enjoy the view, report errors to MK (also send rs_admin_upgrade.log)
9. When finished, pcrack, login to GUI and walk around, test as much as you can
